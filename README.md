## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

#### Problem solving
- I have a methodical approach to problem solving. For example, during the Makers bootcamp

#### Test Driven Development

#### Agile approach
- I'm an expert in agile working practices and principles
- 

#### Collaborating with others

- I have strong collaboration and communication skills that mean I'm able to work very effectively and harmoniously with other people.
- In my product manager roles I used these skills to lead multi-disciplinary teams of developers, designers, user researchers and performance analysts to understand the needs of users and build a product that meets their needs. For example, I wrote user stories and gained consensus by discussing them with the team during sprint planning. I also demonstrated my facilitation skills by leading team workshops, demoing products at show & tells, running daily stand ups and facilitating team retros.
- I've used these skills during the Makers Academy bootcamp to ensure pairing sessions with other developers are as collaborative as possible, and during group engineering projects to ensure the team works effectively.

## <a name="interests">Interests</a>

Outside of coding, I love playing sports and keeping fit. I played professional football in League Two with Darlington F.C. and have continued to play semi-professionally ever since. I gym regularly, play golf when I can, and occassionally attend the odd yoga class.
