## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

#### Collaborating with others

- I have strong collaboration and communication skills that mean I'm able to work effectively and harmoniously with other people.
- In my product manager roles I used these skills to lead multi-disciplinary teams of developers, designers, user researchers and performance analysts to understand the needs of users and build a product that meets their needs. For example, I owned the direction and priorities for products, communicated the vision/goals to the team and got buy in from the team and stakeholders. I also demonstrated my facilitation skills by leading team workshops, show & tells, daily stand ups, sprint planning and retros.
- I've used these skills during the Makers Academy bootcamp to ensure pairing sessions with other developers are as collaborative as possible, and during group engineering projects to ensure the team works iteratively towards an agreed goal.

#### Agile approach

- I've worked in an agile environment for 10 years and have 7 years experience of directly leading product teams using agile approaches and working practices.
- In my product manager roles I've led the development of products through the agile phases of delivery (discovery, alpha, beta and live). This has given me a deep understanding of agile methodology and practical experience of why it is so important to the successful outcome of product development.
- I've continued to implement agile methodology and practices throughout the Makers Academy bootcamp. For example, I supported my team in the group engineering projects to take an agile approach by working in sprints, prioritising a minimum viable product, sketching a design and writing user stories.

#### Problem solving
- I have a methodical approach to problem solving by understanding the problem and iteratively working towards the best solution.
- As a product manager I worked closely with user researchers to understand the problem users were facing and defined their needs in discovery. I explored potential approaches to solving the problem through prototyping and user research activities before converging on the best idea to solve it. During the alpha phase, I tested the solution with users using prototypes and improved it through an iterative cycle based on evidence gathered. In beta I tested the live product with a subset of users through usability testing and analysing web analytics, and iteratively improved the product based on evidence.
- I've demonstated my problem solving skills througout the Makers Academy bootcamp by understanding the coding challenges, planning an approach at the start, writing user stories for required features and prioritising the minimum viable product first. When building the solution I've test driven it using a red, green, refactor approach, used a methodical debugging process to unblock myself, and iteratively worked towards the final solution.

#### Test Driven Development
- I take a test driven approach to writing programs and applications.
- During the Makers Academy bootcamp I've gained a solid understanding of what test driven development is, practical experience of taking a test driven approach and understood why it is so important.
- Test driven development is now fundamental and ingrained in my development approach. I've put it into practice during pairing sessions, individual projects and group projects throughout the bootcamp.

Analysed the triggers that sent emails and made product improvements that reduced the volume of unnecessary emails sent out to users.
- **Ask a question at the coronavirus press conference product** - built and launched a temporary service to collect and choose questions from the public for ministers and senior officials to answer at the daily coronavirus press conference.
- **Content Data product** - built and iterated a new data product to help government publishers use data to inform their content decisions. Led a multi-disciplinary team from discovery through to releasing the public beta product [Content Data](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2019/06/05/helping-content-designers-access-gov-uk-data-quickly-and-easily/). 71% of 2,000 publishers and 79% of 182 government organisations were using the product.
- **Content Publisher product** - supported a new Product Manager to build and release a private beta of a [new publishing tool](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2019/04/23/building-and-testing-the-new-content-publisher/) to better meet the needs of government publishers.
- **Contextual communications discovery** - Led a discovery to explore if government should use GOV.UK’s reach to communicate contextual government messages with citizens. Considered existing research from the advertising industry, tested prototypes in the lab, ran an experiment on GOV.UK and made recommendations to the Head of GOV.UK.
- **Search product** - led a multidisciplinary team to remove considerable tech debt and make it easier to support GOV.UK Search, and [made improvements to search results](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2017/11/14/using-ab-testing-to-measurably-improve-common-user-journeys/) for users.
- **Mainstream migration** - led a development team to [migrate a GOV.UK publishing tool](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/22/using-gov-uks-new-publishing-platform-for-mainstream-formats/) (mainstream publisher which is responsible for the content that receives 80% of all GOV.UK’s traffic) to a new, simpler and easier to support publishing architecture.
- **Local Links Manager product**- built and iterated a new product to manage links from GOV.UK to local council websites and services. Led a multi-disciplinary team from alpha through to releasing a public beta product. Retired a legacy, not iterable and expensive system called ‘Local Directgov’ and replaced it with the new Local Links Manager product.
- **Campaigns and Blogs product** - managed ongoing maintenance and support with a supplier for GOV.UK’s campaign and blog platforms.

## <a name="interests">Interests</a>

Outside of coding, I love playing sports and keeping fit. I played professional football in League Two with Darlington F.C. and have continued to play semi-professionally ever since. I gym regularly, play golf when I can, and occassionally attend the odd yoga class.
