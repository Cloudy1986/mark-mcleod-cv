Led a multi-disciplinary team from discovery through to releasing the public beta product [Content Data](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2019/06/05/helping-content-designers-access-gov-uk-data-quickly-and-easily/). 71% of 2,000 publishers and 79% of 182 government organisations were using the product.

## <a name="interests">Interests</a>

Outside of coding, I love playing sports and keeping fit. I played professional football in League Two with Darlington F.C. and have continued to play semi-professionally ever since. I gym regularly, play golf when I can, and occassionally attend the odd yoga class.
